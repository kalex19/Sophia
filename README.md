The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

## Description

This project is a to-do app for caregivers and seniors. An an MVP, the user is able to create a to-do list and add items to the to-do list or delete items or lists once completed. Once fully developed, the user will be able to create an acount, log in, create lists and items, complete lists and items, and star lists and items by increasing the importance of the list/item or by adding a due date to the list/item for when the to-do needs to be done and then share those lists with another user. This allows the caregiver and the senior to both have accounts - the senior creates their to-dos and the caregiver is sure to get them done.

## Project Successes

This project was developed over several days using genuine TDD. This process was exciting as real TDD rarely happens to do the difficulty of testing front-end applications. The developer also took on the challenge of building out a backend server, which proved to be successful.

## Project Challenges

 Fetching data was often a challenge and many new error messages arose, testing the developer's ability to de-bug problems. The development timeline for this project was shorter due to the test driven development. Often applications are built and then test if there is time. in this case, the tests were written, failed, the app was built, and then the code was tested and revised to match the tests. Time management was key in the completion of this project.
